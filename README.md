## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Your task is very simple: given two integers 
A and B, write a program to add these two numbers and output the sum.

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T, the total number of test cases.
Then follow 
T lines, each line contains two integers, 
A and B.
## Output Format
For each test case, add 
A and B and display the sum in a new line.

## Constraints
1<= T <=1000 <br>
0<=A,B<=10000
## Sample 1:
## Input          Output
    1   2             3
    100 200           300
    10  40            50

## Explanation:
Testcase 1: 
1
+
2
=
3
1+2=3. Hence the first output is 
3
3.

Testcase 2: 
100
+
200
=
300
100+200=300. Hence the second output is 
300
300.
